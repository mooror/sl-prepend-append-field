Documentation
------------

Originally inspired by Cpanel's database fields and bootstrap's input groups, this module adds a new form field type to silvertripe called PrependAppendField. This field type is a subclass of the TextField but with the addition of prepending and appending functionality (+ basic validation). This added functionality allows for a very simple way of appending or prepending strings onto user input and storing it in the database.

Installation
------------

Currently this module is not in packagist.org and therefor you will have to install it manually. [See here for more info](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3/developer_guides/extending/modules/#from-an-archive-download)
<!-- ```
composer require "mooror/sl-prepend-append-field"
``` -->
